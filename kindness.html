  <h1>What is Being Kind?</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">An intro to the Trans-Fem* Support Group</h2>

  <h2>What is Trans-Fem*?</h2>
  <p>Trans–Fem* is a support, social, and
     resource group for transwomen, intersex, non-binary & questioning people who
     were assigned male at birth. We meet for fun, discussion & support around what it
     means to be on the trans-feminine spectrum. There are no requirements for
     transition status or presentation to attend this group. Our goals as a support group
     are to help each other heal from traumas, help each other find the resources we
     need, and promote social well-being by creating empathetic connections with each
     other.</p>
  
 <h2>What does it mean to be kind?</h2>
 <p>Our one broad group agreement is to “be kind.” This is a simple reminder to help
    facilitate the above stated group goals. Some examples of what being kind might
    look like include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pausing between people speaking. This helps people process and makes
          certain one person is done talking before another person begins. Don’t be
          afraid of silence.</li>
      <li>Trying active listening and making more of your talk time responding to
          others contributions if you tend to talk a lot in groups.</li>
      <li>Being bold: it’s okay to be vulnerable in our support group that’s why we
          meet.</li>
      <li>Not worrying about the discussion “moving on”: if you want to go back to
          something, feel free to bring it back up especially if you tend to be quiet in
          group settings.</li>
      <li>Speaking from personal experience rather than generalizing or giving
           second-hand information.</li>
      <li>Avoiding side conversations and crosstalk.</li>
      <li>Being present and showing that you value what others have to say.</li>
      <li>Take care of yourself. Make accommodations and advocate for yourself if a
          discussion is upsetting to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By thinking about and implementing these ideas as you navigate your time at
     Trans-Fem* you can help yourself get support and help others get effective support
     as well. Thank you for joining us!</p>
