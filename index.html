    <h1>Trans-Fem*</h1>
  <p>We are a support, social, and resource group for transwomen, intersex, non-binary & questioning people who are looking to cultivate a more femme
     gender expression, presentation, and/or identity.
     We meet for support, fun, & discussion around what it means to be on the trans-feminine spectrum. There are no requirements for transition status
     or presentation to attend this group.</p>
  <p>Trans-Fem* is currently holding virtual and in-person support group meetings. For more information contact Danielle at dani@transfem.group</p>

 <h2 class="blue">Group Intentions and Etiquette</h2>
 <p>Our one broad group agreement is to be kind. This is a simple reminder to help
    facilitate our group goals: Our goals as a support group
    are to help each other heal from traumas, help each other find the resources we
    need, and promote social well-being by creating empathetic connections with each
    other. Some examples of what being kind might
    look like include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pausing between people speaking. This helps people process and makes
          certain one person is done talking before another person begins. Don't be
          afraid of silence.</li>
      <li>Trying active listening and making more of your talk time responding to
          others contributions if you tend to talk a lot in groups.</li>
      <li>Being bold: it's okay to be vulnerable in our support group that's why we
          meet.</li>
      <li>Not worrying about the discussion "moving on": if you want to go back to
          something, feel free to bring it back up especially if you tend to be quiet in
          group settings.</li>
      <li>Speaking from personal experience rather than generalizing or giving
           second-hand information.</li>
      <li>Avoiding side conversations and crosstalk.</li>
      <li>Being present and showing that you value what others have to say.</li>
      <li>Taking care of yourself. Make accommodations and advocate for yourself if a
          discussion is upsetting to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By thinking about and implementing these ideas as you navigate your time at
     Trans-Fem* you can help yourself get support and help others get effective support
     as well.</p>
  <h3>Zoom Tips</h3>
  <p>Please mute yourself unless talking (you can use spacebar/alt+a on a computer to unmute) to avoid background noise.
     A group facilitator might mute you if they hear background noise, feel free to unmute when you are ready to talk.
     Using the Gallery view allows you to see everyone at once.
