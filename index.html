  <h1>Trans-Fem*</h1>
  <p>We are a support, social, and resource group for transwomen, intersex, non-binary & questioning people who are looking to cultivate a more femme gender expression.
     We meet for fun, discussion & support around what it means to be on the trans-feminine spectrum. There are no requirements for transition status
     or presentation to attend this group.</p>
  <p>Trans-Fem* is currently holding virtual and in-person support group meetings. For more information contact Danielle at dani@transfem.group</p>
